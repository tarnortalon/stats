      <description>Mean The arithemetic mean of a population, or population mean, is denoted \(\mu\). The sample mean is the mean of a sample of values drawn from the population.
The sample mean is a good estimator of the population mean. Its expected value is equal to the population mean (that is, itâ€™s an unbiased estimator).
The sample mean is a random variable, because its value depends on the sample drawn from the population.</description>
